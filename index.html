            <h2>About-Me:$<span class="cursor"></span></h2>
            <p>I am Vaibhav Agarwal, an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Economics at Azim Premji University in Bangalore. My contact details are available at +91-78291-91110, and I can be reached at vaibhav.agarwal20ug@apu.edu.in. A glance at my work is available online on my <a href="https://vaibhavagarwaleconomics.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"> Portfolio Website</a>. A similar, yet more comprehensive verison of the same is avaible at -- <a href="https://vibsretail.com/home/" target="_blank">About Me</a></p>
            <p>I am an organized and hard-working economics graduate. I enjoy brainstorming possible solutions and policy recommendations using a political economy, data-driven approach through presentations, papers, and other forms of creative expression such as videos, podcasts, and posters. I am particularly interested in answering questions relating to growth, inequality and spatial economics; and, I am passionate about using my data analysis and visualization skills to present information clearly and effectively, making it comprehensible to the blind and colorblind as well. </p>
            <p>I aspire to be an economist and researcher in the field of economic growth, sustainable development, and structural transformation. Additionally, I am interested in studying East Asian Economies and comparing them with India. My primary research interests include sustainable development, economic growth theories, development economics, and spatial economics. I am also interested in the impact of heterogeneity and culture on development outcomes in societies, clean energy transition, and data visualization for the colorblind. My expected graduation date from Azim Premji University is May 2023, and I have a major in Economics and a minor in Data, Democracy & Development Economics.</p>

            <h2>My Projects:$<span class="cursor"></span></h2>
            <p>At the outset, I would like to mention that all my projects and work are available to access via a link, which is <a href="https://vaibhavagarwaleconomics.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"> Portfolio Website</a>. This website provides an extensive collection of my research work, visualization projects, and collaborations in the fields of development and spatial economics,  color blind friendly visualizations and deep learning. I invite you to explore this website to get a comprehensive understanding of my areas of interest and expertise.</p>
            <p>Throughout the course of my Bachelor's degree , I have been engaged in a plethora of projects, ranging from research manuscripts to visualization endeavors. One of my most exciting projects includes a manuscript that examines conditional convergence between developing and developed nations with an addition for a control for investment in renewable energy projects. Using an augmented Solow model, I meticulously analyzed and tested for conditional convergence, and I am currently seeking publication. I take great pride in the work I have accomplished and believe that this study will provide insightful implications for the efficacy of renewable energy projects, particularly in the developing world.</p>
            <p>I have also been engrossed in the collection of literature pertaining to carbon capture utilization and storage in India. Ascertaining the economic, ecological, and environmental feasibility of this phenomenon, I have collaborated with a peer who shares my passion for research in this area. This project has involved digitizing maps utilizing QGIS; it has proven to be challenging yet exceedingly fascinating. Concurrently, I have embarked on an individual project that involves a comparative lens examining economic development in India and China. Specifically, I am examining how China has created debt traps for numerous countries globally, while scrutinizing investment and loans in renewable energy. I have found this project to be particularly intriguing as it has enabled me to delve into the diverse approaches that India and China have adopted regarding renewable energy development. </p>
            <p>In addition to my research projects, I have immersed myself in two visualization projects. The first of these projects encompasses transforming approximately fifteen different types of graphs into monochrome color-blind-friendly graphs; utilizing shapes, patterns, hues, and clean labeling. This project will enhance accessibility for individuals with color vision deficiencies. Secondly, I have assisted in a workshop series geared towards teaching statistics to individuals who are blind or visually impaired. I am a firm believer in the concept of making education accessible to all, and this project epitomizes my dedication to that cause. 
            <p>Lastly, I have a deep-rooted fascination with deep learning and artificial intelligence, and have been collaborating closely with a faculty member on developing deep learning algorithms to assist blind individuals in detecting obstacles. This project has been particularly fulfilling as it has allowed me to harness my expertise and skills to aid individuals with visual impairments.</p>

            <h2>About the Webiste:$<span class="cursor"></span></h2>
            <p>This website is created using simple HTML and CSS code and the Winbox JavaScript bundle. I have taken inspiration from the windows powershell terminal and the design was inpired by tiffany white. I would also like to thank Matt Boldt for the typed.js text animation script. </p>
            <p>The World Wide Web or www is a collection of billions of links; a cyber lair in one sense of the Earth. Inside the world wide Web I have made my own world wide Web which is a collection of my work, my passions, my interests and my ideas; I hence, refer to this website as my  cyber lair. Ironically, my cyber lair is hosted on GitHub Pages, which is hosts million other such websites.</p>
            <p> One of my websites is a portfolio website that showcases my research work, visualization projects, and collaborations in the fields of economics, statistics, and deep learning, Another website that I have created is a blog that focuses on color-blind and visually impaired-friendly visualizations using economic datasets. This blog features interesting conclusions drawn from my analyses and provides a forum for discussions on these topics. Finally, I have made a personal store - "V%bs Retail". This store promotes sustainable practices such as reverse shopping and proper waste disposal. Through this store, I hope to contribute to a cleaner and greener planet . Although these websites serve different purposes, they are all interconnected, and they reflect my diverse interests and passions.</p>
